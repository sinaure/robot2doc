Description: # robot2doc
        
        A simple Docx generator for Robot Framework Test Suites
        
        ## Requirements
        
            [sudo] pip install --upgrade -r  requirements.txt [--user]
        
        `sudo` or `--user` may be required (but not together!), depending on the local environment (e.g. OS, if using virtualenv, etc.).
        
        ## Usage
        
            python main.py <robot-tests> [OUT_FILENAME [SECTION_TITLE]]
        
        Command line arguments:
        
        * `robot-tests` a folder or a file containing Robot tests
        * `OUT_FILENAME` filename for the output (e.g. `my-tests.docx`)
        * `SECTION_TITLE` the title for the section in the doc where the tests are included
        
        Other configurable paramenters may be found in `config.py`, such as:
        
        * ` DOC_CLAUSE_LVL_*`, the starting number for the sections numbering, with `LVL_1` being the number of the toplevel clause.
        * `DRY_RUN`, if True, no output Docx file is created
        * `QUIET`, if True, output on stdout is minimized
        * `GIT_COMMIT_PREFIX`, If not empty, a NOTE is added after each test with this URL concatenated to the name of the Robot file(s) in input
        
        
        ## How to write the tests
        
        For each test in each test suite, the tool will extract the documentation and parse
        each line as a key-value pair, separated by `:`.
        
        If the separator is not present, the entire line is used as the value and the key
        is omitted.
        
        Example:
        
            [Documentation]    Test Name: This is the test name. 
                ...    Another key: Another value. 
                ...    This line does not present a key, therefore the key is omitted. 
                ...    Post-conditions: After the test you will be happy.
                Log    Test starts...
                Etc. etc.
        
        ### Test ID
        
        If one of the fields in the documentation is called `Test ID`, the string next to it is used as the reference number for the subclause of the document.
        
        ## Tests
        
        Few tests for the internals are created in the `robot2doc` folder.
        To execute the tests you need to install the `pytest` module, then in the folder of the test
        run the command:
        
            $ python -m "pytest"
        
        or to filter only one of the files use `-k`, e.g.:
        
            $ python -m "pytest" -k testpurpose
